## Project Descriptions

The following projects are included in the `python project.ipynb` file:

1. **RSA Algorithm (Gradio Interface)**  
   An interactive RSA encryption and decryption tool with a Gradio-powered web interface.

2. **DNA Animation Structure**  
   A visualization of the DNA double helix structure in motion.

3. **Tic Tac Toe**  
   A simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game with two-player mode.

4. **Countdown**  
   A customizable countdown timer.

5. **Sports Shop Management System**  
   A basic inventory and sales management system for a sports shop.

6. **Calendar Maker**  
   Generates a calendar for any specified month and year.

7. **Tower of Hanoi**  
   A solution to the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle, displaying each step.

8. **RSA Algorithm (Command Line)**  
   A basic implementation of RSA encryption and decryption, using standard input and output.

## Installation

To run these projects locally:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SPPramod/Python-Projects.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd Python-Projects
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook and Gradio installed:

    ```bash
    pip install gradio
    ```

4. Launch the Jupyter notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the `python project.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run the cells corresponding to the project you'd like to explore.
3. For projects using Gradio (like RSA Algorithm), a web interface will be launched to interact with the code.
